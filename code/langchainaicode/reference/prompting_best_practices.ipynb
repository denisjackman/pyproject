        "\n",
        "\"Fui a la tienda\" (\"I went to the store\"): The verb \"Fui\" is in the preterite tense, first person singular form of the verb \"Ir\" (to go). The preterite tense is used for actions in the past that are seen as completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"a comprar alimentos\" (\"to buy groceries\"): Here we see the infinitive verb \"comprar\" (to buy) used to express the purpose of going to the store. The infinitive form is the base form of a verb, often used after prepositions and certain verbs. In this case, the preposition \"a\" indicates the purpose of the action.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"para poder cocinar la cena\" (\"in order to cook dinner\"): \"Poder\" (can/to be able to) is also in the infinitive form, indicating the ability or possibility. \"Cocinar\" (to cook) is another infinitive verb, which is the action that will be enabled by buying groceries. The word \"para\" (in order to) is used to express the goal or objective of buying groceries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"para mi familia\" (\"for my family\"): Here \"para\" is used as a preposition to indicate the beneficiary of the action (cooking dinner).\n",
        "\n",
        "\"más tarde hoy\" (\"later today\"): \"Más tarde\" (later) is an adverbial phrase used to indicate the time when the action (cooking dinner) will happen. \"Hoy\" (today) specifies the day.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in summary, this sentence uses the preterite tense to express a completed past action and several infinitive verbs to express purpose, ability, and planned future actions. The preposition \"para\" is used to indicate purpose and beneficiary, and the adverbial phrase \"más tarde hoy\" indicates future time.\"\"\"\n",

            "\n",
            "\"después del entrenamiento\" (\"after practice\"): \"Después de\" is a preposition meaning \"after\" and \"el entrenamiento\" means \"the practice\".\n",
            "\n",
            "\"que me dormí\" (\"that I fell asleep\"): \"Que\" is a conjunction meaning \"that\" and it introduces a dependent clause. \"Me dormí\" is the past tense of the reflexive verb \"dormirse\" (to fall asleep) and it means \"I fell asleep\". \n",
            "\n",
            "\"en cuanto llegué a casa\" (\"as soon as I got home\"): \"En cuanto\" is a conjunction meaning \"as soon as\". \"Llegué\" is the past tense of the verb \"llegar\" (to arrive) and it means \"I got\". \"A casa\" means \"home\".\n",
            "\n",
