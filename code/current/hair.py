# First, let’s sum up all the prices of haircuts.
# Create a variable TOTAL_PRICE, and set it to 0
# 1) Carly wants to be able to market her low
#    prices. We want to find out what the average
#    price of a cut is.
#
# 2) Loop through the prices list and add each
#    price to the variable TOTAL_PRICE.
#    After your loop, create a variable called
#    average_price that is the TOTAL_PRICE divided
#    by the number of prices.
#    You can get the number of prices by using
#    the len() function.
#
# 3) That average price is more expensive than
#    Carly thought it would be! She wants to cut
#    all prices by 5 dollars.
#    Use a list comprehension to make a list called
#    new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.
#
# 4) Print new_prices.
#    Carly really wants to make sure that Carly’s
#    Clippers is a profitable endeavor. She first
#    wants to know how much revenue was brought in last week.
#    Create a variable called TOTAL_REVENUE and set it to 0.
#    Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes
#    from 0 to len(hairstyles)
#
# 5) Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the
#    haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the
#    number of people who got the haircut at
#    position i) to TOTAL_REVENUE at each step.
#    After your loop, print the value of TOTAL_REVENUE
#
# 6) Find the average daily revenue by dividing
#    TOTAL_REVENUE by 7. Call this number
#    average_daily_revenue and print it out.
#    Carly thinks she can bring in more customers
#    by advertising all of the haircuts she has
#    that are under 30 dollars.
#    Use a list comprehension to create a list
#    called cuts_under_30 that has the entry
#    hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i]
#    is less than 30.
#    Print cuts_under_30.
