Conquer manual

- Players goal is to eliminate enemy players.

Units:
	Soldier - Unit that conquers land. Has 6 power levels.
			  (1 being the weakest and 6 the strongest)
	
	Resource Dump - Your islands base of action

Island:

	Two or more same colored lands that are connected. Every island
	has its own resource dump. When two islands merge into one larger,
	a new resource dump is build at random location on the island and
	old supplies are brought and added from the two old ones (which
	are then discarded).

Resource Dump:

	Your islands base of action. Resource Dump supply income equals
	to its islands land area. Islands soldiers levels are added to
	expends. Every turn resource dump supplies are changed by following
	amount: income - expends. If supplies drop to zero or below, every
	soldier on the island is killed (a skull is drawn briefly). If
	resource dump is isolated on one land piece, it is discarded. If
	resource dump is conquered by enemy soldier, a new one is created
	at random location on the island but with zero supplies.

Rules conserning soldiers:

	- Soldier can't conquer land which:
			* is defended by stronger soldier
			(meaning the land does not have stronger enemy
			soldier next to it)
			* has own unit
			* is out of reach from your island

	- If a resource dump or soldier is isolated on one land piece,
	  it is terminated next turn
	  
	- Defending: to have a soldier next to a land piece or resource
				 dump to defend it

	Soldiers level 1:
		Can't conquer resource dumps or lands that an resource dump
