# pyproject

## Introduction

This is a personal python project. It is designed to get me back into
development work. It is also about developing my GitHub profile a bit more.
So with that in mind. You are ensourgaged to Fork , Pull , copy and use this
as you see fit. I will document the work and how to set it up.

## Tools

* Pathmaker : Pathmaker is a tool I have developed to help me with my building paths for python games 
* SpriteChecker: SpriteChecker is a tool I have developed to help with looking at sprites 
* SpriteSheet: SpriteSheet is a tool I have developed to help with unpacking SpriteSheets into individual sprites
