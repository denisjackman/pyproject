# A* Algorithm in Python

Hereâ€™s an implementation of the A* (A-star) search algorithm in Python. This algorithm finds the shortest path between a start and a goal node in a graph or grid, using heuristics to improve search efficiency.

```
import heapq

class Node:
    def __init__(self, position, parent=None):
        self.position = position
        self.parent = parent
        self.g = 0  # Distance from start node
        self.h = 0  # Heuristic (estimated distance to goal)
        self.f = 0  # Total cost (g + h)
    
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.position == other.position

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.f < other.f

## Explanation

* **Grid**: A 2D array where 0 represents a free space, and 1 represents an obstacle.
* **Node**: A class to represent each point in the grid with properties for the path cost g, heuristic h, and total cost f.
* **Open list**: A priority queue (min-heap) that stores nodes to be explored. Nodes with the lowest f value are prioritized.
* **Closed list**: A set of visited nodes that have already been explored.
* **Heuristic**: The Manhattan distance is used in this example to estimate the cost from a node to the goal.
* **Output**: This will output the shortest path from the start to the goal, avoiding obstacles.

You can adjust the grid and the start/goal positions as needed.
